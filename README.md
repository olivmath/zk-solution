# Solution Proposal: zk-SNARK Conversion Tool UltraPlonk → ZKVerify  

## 1. **Executive Summary**  

Currently, developers using the Noir/Nargo stack with the UltraPlonk backend face a critical limitation: **the lack of tools to convert zk-SNARK proofs generated via CLI (`bb`) into a format compatible with ZKVerify**. This prevents direct frontend integrations with modern verifiers.  

I have developed a **functional Proof of Concept (PoC/MVP)** that performs this conversion **natively in JavaScript and in the browser**, allowing proofs to be submitted directly to ZKVerify without manual CLI steps. I am now seeking funding to turn this PoC into a complete, community-maintained tool.

## 2. **Current Problem**  

Developers working with UltraPlonk face the following barriers:  

- Proofs generated by `bb prove` are binary (`.bin`) and incompatible with ZKVerify.  
- Conversion to hex format is only possible via CLI, preventing frontend/browser usage.  
- There is no official solution for runtime conversion via JavaScript.

## 3. **Proposed Solution**  

Creation of an **open-source JavaScript/TypeScript library** that:  

- Converts proofs and `Uint8Array` keys generated by `@aztec/bb.js` to `hex` in Node.js or browser environments.  
- Generates the proof format accepted by ZKVerify from the UltraPlonk structure.  
- Provides a user-friendly API for Web3 developers, DApps, and ZK tools.  

> This library **is already functional as a PoC**, with successful proof submissions to ZKVerify.

## 4. **Proof of Feasibility**  

The developed PoC already demonstrates that:  

- Conversion can be done entirely in Node.js without CLI.  
- The converted format is accepted by ZKVerify's API.  
- It can run in Node.js backend.

## 5. **Roadmap**  

### Duration: **6 weeks**  

### Deliverables:  

- 📦 Public NPM library (or update within `zkverify.js`)  
- 📘 Documentation with 2 usage examples for direct submission to ZKVerify: frontend-only and frontend + backend.  
- 🔬 Automated tests.  
- 🌐 Video demo for both examples.  
- 🧪 Benchmark scripts for conversion time and weight.  

### Timeline:  

| Week  | Activity                                             |  
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |  
| 1     | PoC refactoring, public interface definition         |  
| 2     | Implementation of proof and key conversion           |  
| 3     | Frontend support (browser-friendly)                  |  
| 4     | Automated tests and documentation                    |  
| 5     | Integration with ZKVerify + real-world example       |  
| 6     | Optimizations and official NPM + GitHub publication  |

## 6. **Expected Impact**  

- Enables new frontend integrations with UltraPlonk.  
- Encourages the use of the Noir/Nargo stack in real-world products.  
- Strengthens the ZK ecosystem and interoperability with ZKVerify.
